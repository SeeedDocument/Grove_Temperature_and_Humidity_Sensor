# Grove - Temperature and Humidity Sensor
## Introduction
---
This is a multifunctional sensor that gives you temperature and relative humidity information at the same time. It utilizes a DHT11 sensor that can meet measurement needs of general purposes. It provides reliable readings when environment humidity condition in between 20% RH and 90% RH, and temperature condition in between 0°C and 50°C, covering needs in most home and daily applications that don't contain extreme conditions.
